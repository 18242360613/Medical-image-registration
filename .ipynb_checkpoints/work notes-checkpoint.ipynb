    "The latter gives desired result, the former does not (Gradient seems to be very small for its update).\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style = 'color: blue'> The truth is the mechanism of `tf.reshape()`, it will start filling the tensor using digits beginning from the last dimension of the original tensor. The deformation is of shape (batch_size, height, width, 2). So in order to make the information stay in the same channel, you have to do it the latter way. Even though these weight are latent and learned during training.</span>\n",

    "\n",
    "<span style = 'color: blue'> Does not seem to help much, there will be stripes at the border, and the loss curve does not look nice. Maybe other preprocess will help, check what do others do. </span>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Warping small ventricles to large ones seems to be more difficult than the other way around**. \n",
    "\n",
    "<span style = 'color: blue'> This may because of the nature of your SDN which uses the warped grid to sample, if the moving image has a gap that is only 2 or 3 pixels wide, it is hard for many grid points to be squeezed in that gap. </span>\n",
